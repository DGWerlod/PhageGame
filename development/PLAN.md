#PhageGame Plan

##### Capture-the-flag, checkpoint-based game (like Battle Cats)

Two sides: Bacteriophages invading from a cut and Macrophages defending a cell

Checkpoints are:
-	Sneeze machines (bacteriophages)
-	Brick walls (macrophages)

Buff qualities:
-	Massive arms as legs (bacteriophages)
-	Extend-o-feet (macrophages)

Magic-eight-ball style upgrading (look into top of bacteriophage)

Bacteriophages can:
-	Inject life-force to deal more damage (suicide bomber-type?)

Macrophages can:
-	Consume defeated enemies for more health

Other ideas:
- Three walls + base = fourth, make fourth wall jokes

## Minimum Viable Product:
Delay the following classes:
- Level and subclasses
- All but one subclass of Bacteriophage / Macrophage
- Upgrade and System Buttons
- Text
- Wall?
